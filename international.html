            <h1>Global Public Relations</h1>
            
            The definition of public relations is the management of relationships between an organization and the publics on whom the organization depends for its success and survival (Kelly, 2012). However, public relations has many nuances from organization to organization, especially when dealing with international publics. This niche of public relations is sometimes also known as global public relations.
	   <br><br>Although some companies begin in the United States, they often expand internationally. This presents a unique set of hurdles for these companies to cross. The publics may change, along with the customs and culture of the country. Considerations when dealing with a foreign market may include governmental regulations, ethics, translation, target markets, societal norms, culture, and customs.
	   <br><br>Additionally, the niche of employee relations will be affected when practicing public relations internationally. Employee relations refers to the communication with current, former and potential employees. Good employee relations is key to keeping employees happy and informed about the organization.
    <br><br>However, even when working internationally, the basic public relations model of ROPES should be practiced. The ROPES process consists of research, objectives, program, evaluation, and stewardship. Each step is important, but when working internationally, emphasis should be placed on the research step.
	   <br><br>The best approach when dealing with international markets is to think globally but act locally. This means to consider the overall picture including the specifics of the country while working locally in the campaign effort. Actions in one part of the world can affect a company's reputation globally. Additionally, it is vital that communications are done by practitioners who are local to the market. Local practitioners have a better understanding of the local market than a practitioner who is shipped over to the foreign country could ever hope to.
        <br><br>Another consideration when dealing with foreign markets is time zones. Even with the advancement in technology, time zone differences still affect communications.  
        <br><br>Dwight Edmonds, a public relations professional in the construction industry has worked internationally for two years. He explains the importance of understanding the differences among cultures and good leadership.

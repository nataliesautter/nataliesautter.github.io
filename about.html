        <h1>About</h1>
         <h2>Professional Me:</h2>
           
<p>I have the knowledge and drive to assist in communications and marketing. My passions include critical thinking, event planning, public relations, design, and customer service.</p>

<p>My previous coursework at the University of Florida has prepared me to handle all types of communication lines. Courses such as advertising, reporting, public relations campaigns, visual communications, public relations writing, public relations strategy and interpersonal communications have honed my written and oral communication abilities.</p>

<p>Although my academic training has enhanced my skills, I believe my professional experience will also benefit your organization. My work experience includes working with non-profit organizations, planning special events, working with donors and generating public relations materials. My previous writing has been published within marketing pieces used by the five-star accredited Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce and in weekly newsletters. I’ve worked on numerous successful proposals and award-winning applications. Additionally, I have worked as part of a team; I know the value of working together toward a common goal and creating long-lasting relationships with a company’s publics.</p>

<p>I know what to expect in a fast-paced, deadline-driven setting. I have the ability to complete scheduled tasks, as well as managing unexpected events. I can multitask to complete all projects on time.</p>

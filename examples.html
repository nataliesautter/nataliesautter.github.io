        <h1>Examples of Global Public Relations</h1>
        Sometimes companies overlook the subtle differences between cultures when dealing internationally. Coca-Cola is a company that began in America but has expanded its business to over 200 countries, including Canada. In September 2013, Coca-Cola began a promotion that would randomly pair one English word with one random French word on the lids of Vitamin Water in the Canada market. The idea was based on Canada's language being a mix of French and English depending on the region (America, 2013).
	<br><br>While Coca-Cola was smart to recognize the language difference in Canada, they overlooked its nuances. During their review process, they failed to notice that one of the French words was &#34;retard.&#34; In French, it means &#34;late&#34; or &#34;delayed,&#34; however in English it is a derogatory term. As a result, the combination &#34;You Retard&#34; was printed on a lid. The video below has further details (America, 2013).

	<br><br>Best Buy's attempt to penetrate the China market were unsuccessful. Due to the lack of research on the target publics, it was forced to shut down all nine of its locations in the country in 2011. Additionally, Walmart shut down four of its locations in China in 2012 and has plans to shut three more in 2013 (Google Express attracts attention, 2013). The problem with the Walmart model is that the Chinese culture is not drawn to the &#34;Every Day Low Price&#34; model of the company. Additionally, the employee relations are not up to par with what the market in China expects. These problems could have been avoided with better research in the ROPES process.
	<br><br>Other times, companies are very successful in the global efforts. Rotary's &#34;End Polio&#34; campaign has been hugely successful at eradicating and spreading awareness of the disease.

	<br><br>The End Polio campaign has been successful because Rotary recognized the differences and the similarities between cultures. On their website, <a hreef=http://www.endpolio.org/>www.endpolio.org</a>, the audience can choose from eight different languages for the site. Additionally, the images change according to the language selected. Different countries have different celebrities, so this was a great tactic within the campaign. Catering to the different nationalities helps make the audience feel as if the campaign is personal to them, not just a one-size-fits-all approach. When audiences feel personally connected to campaigns, they are more likely to be successful.
	<br><br>Ogilvy Public Relations London also launched a very successful international campaign called &#34;The Gnome Experiment&#34; for the company Kern in 2013. The campaign reached 350 million people in 152 countries. Extensive research was done on target audiences ranging from teachers to teachers to Nobel scientists. Special care was taken to customize the campaign for each target public in each country. Thus, it was successful and is still being implemented (CIPR, n.d.).
